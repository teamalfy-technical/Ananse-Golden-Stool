    excerpt: "Ananse, the spider in human skin, stands guard during a royal birth that carries a deadly secret—a child born with a priest's talisman and a witness who must be silenced.",
    content: `Akan proverb: “When the stars fall to earth, it is the quiet grass that first feels their flame.”

The night I learned that fate can bleed, the stars stooped so low over Awukugua that even the silk-cotton trees looked afraid to lift their crowns.

I have watched many nights. Too many.

I arrived in this world without footsteps and without a shadow, as if the earth refused to admit I belonged to it. The villagers saw only a flash in the sky and a tall stranger leaning on a sacred tree, smiling like a man who had been waiting there since the beginning of the story. When they asked my name, I told them the only truth I could afford.

“I am Ananse,” I said. “I took a wrong turn in a story.”

They laughed, because humans laugh when the answer is too sharp to hold.

They stopped laughing when they realized I did not change.

Years stacked like firewood. Boys became fathers. Fathers became ancestors. And still I remained: spider in human skin, a man-shaped knot in the world’s old rope. The gods did not explain why I persisted. Death did not come to negotiate. So I did what any creature does when it learns it cannot be ended—

I decided I would be the one to decide endings.

Not rumors. Not whispers. Fate.

Because rumors are only smoke. Fate is the fire beneath.

That night, the fire had chosen a hut at the edge of the village—reed-and-clay walls, a thin door, a lantern breathing behind lattice like a living heart. Inside that hut, the future of a kingdom was trying to be born without being heard.

And I, Ananse Boakye, stood guard not against men with spears, but against the oldest weapon in Asanteman:

a mouth.

### The Spider Code

Before I stepped through the door, I recited my rules the way a priest recites names—quietly, not to persuade the gods, but to steady the hands.

One: I kill only when truth will crack the land and make brothers enemies.

Two: I do not kill children. I do not kill a mother unless the child’s life demands it.

Three: I do not paint death in public. I make it look like the world did it by itself.

Rules keep monsters neat.

I had broken rules before. Not often. But enough times to earn the kind of haunting that clings to an immortal man like spiderweb to wet skin.

Sometimes, when the wind drops and the world goes still, I hear them—voices of those I have “tidied” from history. They don’t scream. That would be mercy. They whisper.

*Ananse…*

*Ananse…*

They say my name like it is a proverb people will one day tell their children to make them behave.

I went in anyway.

### The Birth

Kyirama lay on a woven mat, sweat shining on her throat like palm oil. She did not wail. She did not beg. She held her own noise inside her body the way a warrior holds a blade inside his cloth—because to show it too early is to invite another man to grab it.

Two midwives attended her: Akua, silver-haired and steady, smelling of bitter-leaf smoke; and Esi, her niece, younger, eyes wide with prayers she did not know how to finish.

Kyirama was royal blood—sister to the line that would one day wear gold as if it were skin. She had come to Awukugua veiled months ago, escorted by mute priests and by me. No villager had seen her since.

They had guessed she carried something cursed.

They were not wrong.

But the curse was not the child.

The curse was the father.

A priest is not supposed to know a woman. That is not simply custom—custom can bend. It is order. It is the agreement between the shrine and the stool: the priest touches the unseen so the king can touch the seen. If the priest stains himself with ordinary hunger, then the spirits stop being guests and start being owners.

And yet Okomfo Anokye—conjurer, vessel, miracle-worker—had planted his seed in Kyirama.

A priest can hide his hands. He can hide his sins. But a child is a living confession, and that night the confession came with evidence.

Kyirama’s breath hitched. Akua caught the infant in her palms. The baby arrived without announcing himself.

No cry.

Just a tight, clenched fist, as if he had come into the world already holding on to something that did not want to be taken.

Akua’s fingers worked gently at the tiny knuckles.

Esi leaned forward, trembling. “Is he—”

The baby’s hand opened.

In the center of that palm sat the talisman.

Not a bead. Not a trinket for beauty. But a shrine-mark: pale as riverbone, cold as water drawn before dawn, smooth as if it had never belonged to earth at all. It was the kind of charm that does not get given.

It gets born.

And every midwife in Asanteman knows what it means when a child comes holding a priest’s secret.

Akua swallowed hard. “Ayɛ, Nyame.”

Esi made a sound that was half prayer, half funeral.

Kyirama turned her head. Her eyes were open now, sharp with exhaustion and fear. She looked at the talisman the way someone looks at a snake in their home—knowing it is beautiful, knowing it is deadly, knowing it cannot be ignored.

I felt the web tighten.

And then I felt it quiver.

A floorboard sighed.

I turned—

Half an instant too late.

### Obeng Dako and the Theft

Obeng Dako slipped in like a man who had spent his life learning where doors are weakest.

He wore scholar’s beads and the clean scent of palace shea butter—too refined for this hut, too entitled for this hour. He was the Chief Linguist of Kumasi, a man whose job was to shape the king’s mouth into law. He should not have been here.

And yet here he was, sweating, breathing hard, eyes hungry as a hawk’s.

“His Majesty demands tidings,” he panted, voice wrapped in court-cloth to pretend it was polite. “This instant.”

“Tidings wait for dawn,” I said, and stepped between him and the mat. “Leave.”

Obeng smiled like a man smiling at a knife he believes he can convince to become a spoon.

“Ananse,” he said softly, “you of all men know dawn is when stories begin walking.”

Behind me, Esi’s breathing sped up. Akua’s hand hovered over the talisman as if she feared it would burn through her skin.

Obeng’s gaze flicked past my shoulder. He saw it.

That pale thing in the baby’s palm.

Understanding hit his face too fast for him to hide it. His eyes widened—not with horror, but with opportunity.

He bowed—too low, too slow—then backed away, murmuring apologies. “Forgive me. I… I forget myself.”

I watched him carefully.

He was not leaving.

He was measuring.

And then the room gave him what I had not:

a single heartbeat of distraction.

Esi dropped a cloth. It fluttered like a startled bird. Akua reached for it. Kyirama inhaled sharply, a small sound—

And Obeng moved.

Not loudly. Not with drama. With the speed of a man snatching a truth before it can be denied.

His hand shot past me, past Akua’s fingers, past the baby’s open palm—

and closed around the talisman.

For the briefest moment, the child’s fist clenched again, empty now, as if the world had already taught him the first lesson of kings:

*They will take what proves you.*

Obeng slipped through the reed-door.

I could have chased him.

I could have caught him.

I am not slow. I am not human in the ways that matter.

But Rule Three tugged at my wrist: no public death. A struggle outside this hut would make noise. Noise makes witnesses. Witnesses make stories. Stories make fate harder to steer.

Rule One tightened around my throat: Obeng with the talisman was not simply a man stealing a charm. He was a man stealing war.

Because if the wrong ears heard what that talisman meant, the stool would not only wobble—

it would split.

So I did not chase him.

Not yet.

Instead, I turned back into the hut and looked at the two midwives.

They were staring at me like goats stare at the butcher’s rope: not surprised, only aware.

Akua’s chin trembled. Esi’s lips moved in a prayer that had no sound.

They had seen the talisman in the baby’s hand.

They had seen Obeng take it.

They had seen my face when I chose not to follow.

Witnesses.

Two.

Kyirama watched me too, breathing shallow, trying not to shake.

She understood, perhaps better than the others, what my choice meant.

Not for Obeng.

For them.

### The Cleaning

Akua spoke first. Her voice was calm, the calm of someone who has delivered enough children to know the world does not owe anyone a gentle story.

“Spider,” she said, “spin softly.”

She did not beg. That is why I respected her.

Esi sobbed once. Then swallowed it. Then looked at Kyirama as if apologizing for being young.

Rule Two pressed against my ribs. I glanced at Kyirama, at the baby.

I would not touch them.

I did not want to.

And yet the ghosts behind my eyes leaned forward, eager for new company.

I took out a cloth soaked in nightshade and bitter root—things that make the body sleep without struggle, without spectacle. A death that looks like exhaustion finally winning.

Rule Three.

I stepped behind Esi and covered her mouth and nose gently, like a mother quieting a crying child.

Her eyes widened. Tears spilled. Her hands clawed once at my wrist.

Then she softened.

Akua knelt on her own. She tilted her head, exposing the hollow of her throat like a woman presenting her neck to a necklace.

I pressed my thumb there—exactly where breath listens for permission to continue.

She folded without sound.

I worked quickly after that, not out of panic, but out of discipline.

A spider does not leave loose silk.

I wrapped them in linen. I tied their wrists and ankles with cords braided earlier, because my work is never improvised where it matters. I placed smooth stones at their feet and at their hearts.

Then I lifted them—one, then the other—and carried them into the forest.

### Ofin’s Mouth

The Ofin River ran black that night, moving like a sentence spoken too fast to be interrupted.

Water is a faithful accomplice. It takes what you give it. It asks no questions. It does not testify.

At the bank, I paused.

Because the dead were already gathering.

Not the midwives’ ghosts—those take time to remember they are dead. No, the ones that always followed me were there first, waiting like elders at a meeting, silent and judging.

I saw the face of a man I drowned in a different season. I saw the eyes of a woman whose name I never learned because Anokye never asked it. I saw a child who should not have been in my web at all.

Immortality is not a gift.

It is a room where the dead never stop entering.

Akua’s lips were parted as if she still meant to speak.

Esi’s lashes were wet.

“Forgive me,” I told the river—not them. The river. Because the river at least had the decency to pretend it could carry forgiveness downstream.

I eased them into the water.

No splash. No drama.

The Ofin took them the way a hungry thing takes food: efficiently.

The ghosts watched.

And in the hush after, I felt what I always feel after a necessary death:

not guilt—

but the tightening of my hunger.

Because every time I remove a witness, fate becomes cleaner.

And every time fate becomes cleaner, I want it cleaner still.

### The Child Without Proof

When I returned to the hut, Kyirama was asleep from shock and blood-loss, her body finally claiming the rest she had refused while birthing.

The infant lay wrapped in white cloth and royal kente stripe, eyes open.

He watched me.

He did not cry.

He did not fuss.

He stared like an old man in a small body, like someone who had already seen himself crowned and cursed.

I crouched beside him and took his tiny hand. The fist was clenched again—empty now, but stubborn.

“You came holding the truth,” I whispered. “And the world stole it.”

His fingers tightened around mine, surprisingly strong.

I smiled, though there was no joy in it.

“A priest’s child is a dangerous thing,” I murmured. “Because you are not only flesh. You are evidence.”

Outside, the forest breathed. Somewhere far away, an owl called once, then stopped, as if even it had decided this night was not safe for noise.

I leaned closer to the child’s ear.

“I will give you two lives,” I said. “One for the people. One for the spirits.”

He blinked slowly.

“And I will hunt the man who took what you carried,” I went on. “Not because he stole from you. Because he stole from the future.”

I stood.

My hands smelled of river and bitter root.

My mind was already spinning.

Obeng Dako had the talisman now.

A charm born with a priest’s child, proof that could rip the palace in two.

He would run to the only place men run when they think they possess a truth: an audience.

I could kill him tonight, perhaps.

But death is not the only way to control fate.

Sometimes the cleaner victory is to let a man walk into the middle of the web and believe he arrived there by his own clever feet.

I stepped to the doorway and looked up at the low stars.

“Listen,” I told the darkness, to the ghosts, to the gods, to the stubborn world that refuses to die the way I wish it would.

“I am finished cleaning for tonight.”

Then, softer—almost tender:

“Now I begin to write.”`,
    order: 1,
    status: "published",
    readTime: 6,
    publishedAt: new Date(),
};

async function upload() {
    console.log("Uploading Chapter 1...");
    const existing = await db.select().from(chapters).where(eq(chapters.slug, chapter1.slug));

    if (existing.length === 0) {
        console.log("Inserting new chapter...");
        await db.insert(chapters).values(chapter1 as any);
        console.log("Chapter 1 uploaded successfully!");
    } else {
        console.log("Chapter 1 already exists. Updating content...");
        await db.update(chapters)
            .set(chapter1 as any)
            .where(eq(chapters.slug, chapter1.slug));
        console.log("Chapter 1 updated successfully!");
    }
    process.exit(0);
}

upload().catch(err => {
    console.error(err);
    process.exit(1);
});
