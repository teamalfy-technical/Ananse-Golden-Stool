You are Replit’s AI software architect + UX designer + full-stack engineer.

Project:
Build a MOBILE-FIRST interactive story website for “Ananse / The Golden Deception” where users can create accounts, log in, and read serialized chapters as the author publishes daily. The site must feel like a premium reading app (fast, immersive, stateful), not a blog.

Non-negotiables (Product Goals):
- Mobile-first reading experience (phone is primary device).
- Immersive, distraction-free chapter reader.
- Resume exactly where the reader left off (chapter + scroll position).
- Table of Contents (TOC) that scales to many chapters.
- Reader settings: font size + theme toggle (Light/Dark/Sepia).
- Optional engagement: reactions + spoiler-safe comments.
- Optional extras: lore/artifacts pages (spoiler-safe).
- Admin publishing workflow for daily updates.
- PWA-ready (installable + offline cache for last-read chapters).
- Ethical engagement only (no spammy popups, no forced signups before reading).

Preferred Tech Stack (use this unless impossible):
- Next.js (App Router) + TypeScript
- TailwindCSS for styling
- Supabase for Auth + Postgres DB (or Prisma + Neon if Supabase isn’t available)
- Vercel-style patterns but deployable on Replit
- Service Worker (Workbox or custom) + Web App Manifest for PWA
- Analytics: simple event tracking (PostHog optional; otherwise minimal custom table + console logs)

Design Language (Mobile Reading UX):
- Default body text size: 18px on mobile; line-height ~1.6; comfortable margins.
- Max reading width in larger screens (still mobile-first).
- Minimal UI chrome while reading: top bar fades/hides on scroll; reappears on tap.
- Progress bar at top showing chapter scroll progress.
- Sticky end-of-chapter nav: Prev / Next + “Back to TOC”.
- “Resume Reading” card on Home showing last chapter + percentage.
- Theme: Light/Dark/Sepia. Save preference per user (or localStorage for guests).
- Accessibility: high contrast, large tap targets, semantic HTML headings, reduced-motion support.

Core Pages / Routes:
1) / (Home / Library)
   - Story cover + “Start Reading” or “Resume Reading”
   - Latest chapter badge (“Updated today”)
   - Quick entry to TOC
2) /toc
   - Chapter list (in order), read/unread state, progress indicator
3) /read/[slug]
   - Chapter Reader (distraction-free)
   - Top bar: back, TOC, settings
   - Progress bar
   - End-of-chapter: Prev/Next, reactions, comments teaser
4) /login, /signup (or modal auth)
   - Allow guest reading without login
   - Prompt signup only when user wants to save progress, comment, react, or subscribe to updates
5) /settings
   - Theme, font size, notifications opt-in, reduce motion toggle
6) /bookmarks (optional MVP+)
   - saved bookmarks/highlights
7) /extras (optional MVP+)
   - Characters, Glossary, Timeline, Artifact pages

Admin (Author) Requirements:
- /admin (protected route, only author role)
- Create/edit chapters:
  - title, slug, published_at, status (draft/published/scheduled), content (Markdown/MDX)
  - optional: excerpt, cover image, “recap” field
- Schedule publish time (daily releases)
- Quick stats: reads per chapter, completion rate approximation, reactions count

Database Schema (minimum viable):
- users (handled by auth provider) + profile table:
  - id, display_name, role (reader/admin), created_at
- chapters:
  - id, title, slug (unique), content_md, excerpt, published_at, status, created_at, updated_at, order_index
- reading_progress:
  - id, user_id, chapter_id, scroll_y (or progress_pct), updated_at
- reactions:
  - id, user_id, chapter_id, reaction_type, created_at
- comments:
  - id, user_id, chapter_id, parent_id (nullable), content, is_spoiler (bool), created_at, updated_at, deleted_at (nullable)
- optional: subscriptions (for notifications/email), bookmarks, glossary_terms, artifacts

Reader Features (MVP):
- Guest reading (no login required)
- When logged in: sync progress across devices
- Resume reading (guest uses localStorage; logged-in uses DB + localStorage fallback)
- Theme + font size saved (guest localStorage; logged-in store in profile table)
- TOC shows read status and last read chapter highlight
- Chapter reader:
  - clean typography
  - progress bar
  - next/prev navigation
  - reading time estimate per chapter (calculate words/200wpm)
- Reaction buttons at chapter end (e.g., ❤️ 😮 🔥) – only for logged-in (or allow guest locally but encourage signup to save)

Comments (V1):
- Comment section loads only after tapping “View Comments” to avoid slowing reader page
- Spoiler-safe:
  - Only show comments for the chapter the user is on
  - “is_spoiler” comments collapse behind a “Tap to reveal spoiler” control
- Basic moderation for admin: delete/hide comment

PWA & Performance:
- Add manifest.json + icons + theme_color
- Service worker:
  - Cache app shell + static assets
  - Cache last 3 visited chapters for offline reading
  - If offline and user opens a cached chapter, show it; otherwise show friendly offline screen
- Performance budgets:
  - Avoid heavy libraries
  - Lazy-load comments + extras
  - Use next/image for images
  - Use font-display: swap; prefer system font stack for MVP (or 1 webfont max)
- Respect prefers-reduced-motion: disable animations if enabled

SEO:
- Each chapter has clean URL (/read/chapter-1-web-of-beginnings)
- Unique <title> and meta description per chapter
- Basic OpenGraph tags for sharing
- /toc must contain standard <a> links to each chapter (crawlable)

Analytics (lightweight):
Track events (console + optional DB table):
- chapter_view
- chapter_complete (scroll >= 95%)
- reaction_added
- comment_posted
- signup_completed
- notification_opt_in (if implemented)

UI Components:
- ReaderSettingsSheet (bottom sheet): font size, theme, reduce motion
- TOCDrawer (optional): quick TOC in reader
- ProgressBar
- ResumeCard
- SpoilerTag component
- ReactionBar

Content Handling:
- Store chapters in DB as Markdown.
- Render with a Markdown renderer that supports basic formatting (headings, italics, blockquotes).
- Add support for “inline glossary” later (mark terms like [[Ofin River]]).

Deliverables:
1) Working Next.js app with the routes above.
2) Supabase (or equivalent) configured for auth + DB migrations/seed.
3) Seed 3 sample chapters (draft/published mix) + one “Extras” glossary page.
4) Mobile-first UI with theme + font size.
5) Resume reading works for guest + logged-in.
6) PWA installable + offline cache for last-read chapters.
7) Admin can publish new chapters daily without touching code.

Implementation Plan (do in order):
- Setup project + Tailwind + layout shells
- Auth + role-based routing (admin only)
- DB schema + migrations + seed data
- Chapter list + chapter reader (Markdown render) + next/prev navigation
- Progress saving (localStorage + DB sync)
- Reader settings (theme + font size)
- Reactions
- Comments (lazy-load)
- PWA manifest + service worker caching
- Basic SEO tags + OpenGraph
- Polish: accessibility, reduced motion, loading states, error handling

Acceptance Criteria (must pass):
- On mobile, reading feels clean and fast; controls don’t get in the way.
- User closes browser and returns: “Resume Reading” returns them to exact spot.
- TOC is instantly usable and shows progress.
- Theme + font size persist.
- Admin can add a chapter and publish it; it appears in TOC and Home “latest”.
- Works offline for recently read chapters.

Start now by generating the full codebase, file structure, and database setup for Replit.

If you want, I can also tailor this prompt to the exact stack you prefer on Replit (e.g., **Next.js + Supabase** vs **Remix + Prisma**), but the above is already strong enough to produce a full build.
